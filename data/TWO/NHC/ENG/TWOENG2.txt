Special Tropical Weather Outlook
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1005 AM EST Mon Jan 16 2023

For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:

Special Tropical Weather Outlook issued to discuss the potential for 
subtropical development over the northwest Atlantic.

Northwestern Atlantic:
A non-tropical low pressure system centered over the northwestern 
Atlantic Ocean about 300 miles north of Bermuda is producing 
storm-force winds.  Although the cyclone is producing some 
thunderstorm activity near the center, it is embedded in a cold air 
mass with nearby frontal boundaries.  The low is expected to move 
northeastward today and northward tonight, bringing the system over 
much colder waters and across Atlantic Canada by early Tuesday.  
Therefore, it is unlikely that the low will transition to a 
subtropical or tropical cyclone.  Nevertheless, the system is 
expected to remain a strong non-tropical low during the next day or 
so, and additional information, including storm-force wind warnings, 
can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather 
Service.  

No additional Special Tropical Weather Outlooks are scheduled for 
this system.  Regularly scheduled Tropical Weather Outlooks will 
resume on May 15, 2023, while Special Tropical Weather Outlooks will 
be issued as necessary during the off-season. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...near 0 percent.
